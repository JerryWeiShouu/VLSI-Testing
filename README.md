# VLSI Testing
The course consisted of 7 assignments, where each task incrementally extended a basic PODEM implementation to incorporate and apply the algorithms covered in lectures.

## Assignment 0
### Description:
Get yourself familiar with the data structure of the podem test generation package (though we do not use the test generation part yet). 
Please use the circuit parser to read benchmark circuits and then output the following attributes of a circuit. 
Choose benchmark circuits according to different criteria including combinational, sequential, optimized ,and non-optimized, larger or small circuits, etc.

### Usage:
```
./atpg -ass0 [circuit_name]
Example:
./atpg -ass0 c17.bench
```
